## 🚀 About Me

Hey everyone I am a Computer Science Major who gradiated this past June , I am a highly motivated individual who was introduced to the realm of computers very early in life by my mother since then I have been keen to learn more everyday! I am very facinated by the technology and new inovations for me computer science is not just a skill or something i studied but a way of life. It’s a way to create, to solve, to connect. It’s how I make sense of the world.
On the days i am not working on a full stack project or learning about AI I love to attend a hip hop dance workshop or make some art , you might find me doing DIY artwork whenever possible.
Thank you for taking the time out to read about me !
